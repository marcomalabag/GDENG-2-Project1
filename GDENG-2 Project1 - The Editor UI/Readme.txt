Instructions on how to run:
What I'm sending is the project for the rendering system and not the whole solution because 
that solution is tied to other versions of the rendering system. Therefore either create a new 
solution in visual studio 2022 or 2019 then add the project to that solution. Alternatively, you 
could use an existing solution and add the project there.  In the solution, ensure that GDENG-2 Project1 - 3D Rendering 
is set as the startup project. Then press Run/Debug and the project should be able to run.
