Instructions on how to run:
What I'm sending is what I have so far for the rendering scene test case and not the whole solution because 
that solution is tied to other versions of the rendering system. Therefore, either create a new 
solution in visual studio 2022 or 2019 then add the project to that solution, or use an existing solution and add the project there.  
In the solution, ensure that GDENG-2 Project1 - The Editor UI  
is set as the startup project. Then press Run/Debug and the project should be able to run. 

Location of the main class:
The main function is in a filter called app along with the appwindow class.
