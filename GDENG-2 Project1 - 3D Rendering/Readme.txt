Instructions on how to run:
What I'm sending is the project for the rendering system and not the whole solution because 
that solution is tied to other versions of the rendering system. Therefore, just create a new 
solution in visual studio 2022 or 2019 then add the project to that solution. In the solution, 
ensure that GDENG-2 Project1 - 3D Rendering is set as the startup project. Then press Run/Debug 
and the project should be able to run.
